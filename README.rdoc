== Code Breaker Game

The code-breaker submits a guess of four numbers. The game marks the guess with + and - signs.

For each number in the guess that matches the number and position of a number in the secret code, the mark includes one + sign. For each number in the guess that matches the number but not the position of a number in the secret code, the mark includes one - sign.

Each position in the secret code can only be matched once. For example, a guess of 1134 against a secret code of 1234 would get three plus signs: one for each of the exact matches in the first, third, and fourth positions. The number match in the second position would be ignored.
